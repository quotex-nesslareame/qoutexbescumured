## Complaint Details

-   **Unreturned Funds:** Rayaz\'s funds have not been credited to his
    bank account or returned to his Quotex wallet.
-   **Lack of Transparency and Support:** The Quotex support team has
    not provided critical information like the SWIFT code, which is
    required by his bank to trace the transaction. They also attribute
    the delay to their "financial operator" without providing any
    specifics.
-   **Financial and Personal Impact:** The prolonged delay has placed a
    strain on Rayaz\'s family\'s finances, and these funds are urgently
    needed.

## Request for BrokersView\'s Assistance

Rayaz is requesting BrokersView\'s assistance in urging Quotex to
expedite the process and credit his funds back to his bank account or
Quotex wallet. He believes that BrokersView can assist in resolving this
matter promptly.
